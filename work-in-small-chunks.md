Work in small chunks/ work with a subset of full data/develop with a subset of data/ don't load up all your data/work in parts/Isolate the system/ work with minimal testable data.


When debugging: Isolate a small amount of testable data. You shouldnâ€™t work with huge amounts of data, because feel out of control, hard to get a handle on it all. Also slower, etc.. (from ETL, and debugging apps)

More data  = more time as increasing memory usage, increasing CPU cycles, increased networking communication. Generally linear O(n)
